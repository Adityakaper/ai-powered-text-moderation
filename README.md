This project is a Flask-based web application that provides user authentication (registration, login, logout) and content moderation functionality. It uses a MySQL database to store user data securely with hashed passwords. The main feature allows users to submit text content or upload .txt files, which are then analyzed for various categories of harmful or sensitive content such as hate speech, violence, sexual content, and self-harm. The moderation system scores the content based on keyword occurrences and presents the results to the user. The app uses Flask-Login for session management, Flask-WTF for form handling, and Flask-Bcrypt for password hashing. The web interface is rendered using HTML templates.
